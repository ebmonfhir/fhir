<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>

<p>The scope of the Evidence resource is to describe the conditional state (population and exposures being considered or compared within a population) with or without the outcomes that knowledge (evidence, assertion, recommendation) is about.

The Evidence resource is a commonly bundled series of evidence variables from the "PICO" specification of medical knowledge:

Population - the population within which exposures and outcomes are being considered 
Intervention - the conditional state or exposure state being described for which one is expressing the risk of or effect on an outcome 
Comparison - the alternative conditional state or alternative exposure state when one is comparing states for the effect on an outcome 
Outcome - the result or effect of an intervention or exposure in a population

PICO (and its variants like PECO or PICOT) is a universal acronym used in evidence-based medicine communities to clearly express research questions and evidence findings.

The Evidence resource allows expression of the higher-order concept for recommendations in healthcare where multiple outcomes are considered, and the higher-order concept/combination for framing research questions.</p>

<div>
<h2>Boundaries and Relationships</h2>
<p>The Evidence resource references the EvidenceVariable resource two or more times to clearly specify the relationship among evidence variable concepts in framing a research question, evidence assertion, or recommendation.</p>

<h2>Background and Context</h2>
<p>
Description of the population for which a recommendation or evidence summary is applicable, Description of the intervention or exposure for which a recommendation or evidence summary is applicable, and Description of the comparator state or the evidence is about or what the recommendation is against.

These descriptions could be used in coded specifications of recommendations from clinical practice guidelines to facilitate searching for recommendations that match an individual patient (eg patient is in the population and meets the criteria for the comparator state but not the criteria for the recommended exposure state)

These descriptions could be used in Summary of Findings tables from systematic reviews to facilitate the representation of medical knowledge when creating recommendations.

These descriptions could be used in classification of new evidence reports to facilitate recognition of signal for updating existing evidence summaries and recommendations.
